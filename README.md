## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive gap analysis of a SQLite procurement database against 17 strategic C-Suite procurement reports, identifying coverage gaps and proposing schema enhancements to eliminate external data dependencies.

### 📊 Current Database Status
- **Total Transactions**: 71,932 records (2009-2018)
- **Total Spend**: $509.9M analyzed
- **Vendor Coverage**: 2,716 unique suppliers
- **Category Coverage**: 6,569 commodity codes
- **Database Coverage**: 92% of report requirements met internally

## 📊 Database Schema Overview

### Current Schema (4 tables)
```sql
-- Core transactional data
fact_spend_analytics     -- Transaction facts with performance metrics
dim_vendors             -- Vendor master with ESG and risk data
dim_commodities         -- Category hierarchy and classifications
dim_time               -- Time dimension for reporting
```

### Proposed Enhancements (+12 tables)
```sql
-- Contract and lifecycle management
dim_contracts          -- Contract master data
fact_contract_events   -- Contract milestones and changes

-- Performance and incidents
fact_delivery_events   -- Detailed delivery tracking
fact_quality_events    -- Quality incidents and resolutions

-- Strategic and planning
dim_sourcing_events    -- RFX and sourcing activities
fact_savings_tracking  -- Savings realization tracking

-- And 6 additional enhancement tables...
```
