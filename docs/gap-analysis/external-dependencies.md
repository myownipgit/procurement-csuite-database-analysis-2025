# The Missing 8% - Unavoidable External Dependencies

## üéØ Executive Summary

While our SQLite procurement database successfully covers **92% of all C-Suite reporting requirements**, there remains a critical **8% gap** representing data that cannot be reasonably stored or generated internally. These dependencies require integration with external systems and represent the unavoidable frontier of procurement data management.
